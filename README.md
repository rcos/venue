This project was generated with the [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 3.1.0.

## Getting Started

### Deploying with Docker

If you'd like the run venue without modifying it, you can use our docker image
which you can find at [rcos/venue on the docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rcos/venue/).

The instructions for running the docker image are available on docker hub.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node = 8.10.x, npm >= 2.x.x
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (`npm install --global gulp`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

3. Run `gulp serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

Note: if downgrading/updating to Node 8.10.x, it's recommended to clear wrong versions of modules by running `rm -rf node_modules` before `npm install`.

## Build & development

Run `gulp build` for building and `gulp serve` for preview.

### Building the Docker Image

To build the docker image, go to your venue directory and run the following
command.

`docker build -t rcos/venue .`

You can then upload your image (assuming you have the correct permissions) using

`docker push rcos/venue`

## Testing

Running `npm test` will run the unit tests with karma.
